Oswald Labs Platform is a set of open, extensible APIs and SDKs to build apps. This repository contains (some) code that runs on our servers, primarily serving as a wrapper around various APIs and to prevent API key exposion. Most APIs available here are free for public use with rate limits.

## Endpoints

### Platform APIs

| Endpoint | Details | Params |
| - | - | - |
| `GET /screenshot` | Screenshot image | `url` (webpage URL) |

| `POST /describe` | JSON with AutoALT | `dataUri` (base 64-encoded image) |

### GDPR

ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º **Note:** The GDPR export/delete APIs are served through a brute force prevention middleware, so more than a few requests in a short time will slow down the response (resets in 15 minutes).

## API limits

These APIs are free for public usage with the following rate limits (requests slow down after 500 requests/15 minutes):

| Usage type      | Rate limit          | Total limit             |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Without API key | 200 requests/minute | No daily/monthly limits |
| GDPR export/delete    | Increasing delay      | Renews in 15 minutes |

When you're using authenticated endpoints, use `/secure/*` instead of `/v1/*` to avoid all rate limits and send your API key as `x-api-key` in the header. API keys are available for free to [Oswald Labs Accelerator](https://oswaldlabs.com/accelerator) startups and our partners. Custom-priced API keys are available for everyone else; [get in touch](https://oswaldlabs.com/contact) to request one.
